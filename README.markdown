# XPStat

XPStat is an UI modification for World of Warcraft that makes use of the
[DataBroker](https://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1) library to display
your current experience rate on screen.

## Requirements

This AddOn does absolutely nothing without another a DataBroker AddOn to
display it. I personally use
[StatBlockCore](www.curse.com/addons/wow/stat-block-core) but there are a
variety of other options.
